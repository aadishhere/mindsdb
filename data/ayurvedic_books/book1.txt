Salutations to The Unique and Rare Physician, who has destroyed, without any residue all the diseases like Raga (lust, anger, greed, arrogance, jealousy, selfishness, ego), which are constantly associated with the body, which is spread all over the body, giving rise to disease, delusion, and restlessness. This salutation is done to Lord Dhanwantari.

To achieve the purpose of life, which involves following the path of righteousness (Dharma), earning money in a legal way (Artha), fulfilling our desires (Kama), and ultimately achieving Salvation (Moksha), it is crucial to focus on having a long and healthy life. In the context of Ayurveda, the science that guides us on how to attain this purpose, the most essential quality is 'obedience' (Vidheya). By being obedient and receptive to the teachings of Ayurveda, one can learn the valuable principles and practices that promote well-being and longevity. This obedience allows individuals to align their lifestyle, diet, and habits with the wisdom of Ayurveda, paving the way for a purposeful and fulfilling life.

The origin of Ayurveda can be traced back to Lord Brahma, who passed this ancient knowledge to Prajapathi. Prajapathi, in turn, imparted this wisdom to the Ashwini Kumaras, the divine twins. The knowledge then flowed to Sahasraksa, Lord Indra, who further disseminated it to sages like Atri's son, Atreya Punarvasu, and others. These learned sages, in their turn, shared Ayurveda with disciples such as Agnivesa. Together, Agnivesha and his fellow disciples composed individual treatises, each contributing to the rich tapestry of Ayurvedic wisdom. This ancient lineage underscores the deep roots and reverence that Ayurveda has within the fabric of traditional healing practices.

From the extensive and intricate Ayurvedic texts, essential knowledge is distilled and encapsulated in Ashtanga Hridaya. This compilation strikes a balance, offering neither excessive brevity nor overwhelming complexity. It carefully gathers the essence, making it accessible to those seeking a comprehensive understanding of Ayurveda. Ashtanga Hridaya acts as a bridge, simplifying the profound wisdom contained within the vast Ayurvedic literature for easier comprehension and study.

The branches of Ayurveda, as outlined in ancient texts, encompass a diverse range of medical specialties. Kaya Chikitsa, or General Medicine, deals with overall healthcare. Bala Chikitsa focuses on Pediatrics, while Graha Chikitsa specializes in Psychiatry. Urdhvanga Chikitsa involves the diagnosis and treatment of diseases related to the Ear, Nose, Throat, Eyes, and Head (neck and above region). Shalya Chikitsa is the branch of Surgery, and Damshrta Chikitsa concentrates on Toxicology. Jara Chikitsa is dedicated to Geriatrics, and Vrushya Chikitsa focuses on Aphrodisiac therapy. These eight branches collectively form the foundation of Ayurvedic medicine, each addressing specific aspects of health and well-being.

In Ayurveda, the body's constitution is classified into three fundamental energies known as Tridosha â€“ Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. These energies, when in perfect harmony, maintain a state of health and balance within the body. Vata governs movement and communication, Pitta oversees digestion and metabolism, and Kapha controls stability and structure. When these energies are in equilibrium, an individual experiences good health. However, any imbalance or disharmony among Vata, Pitta, and Kapha can lead to various health issues. Ayurveda emphasizes the importance of balancing these Tridoshas to achieve overall well-being, emphasizing personalized treatments and lifestyle adjustments to restore equilibrium and promote health.

The Tridoshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha) are distributed throughout the body, with specific dominance in certain areas. If we divide the body into three parts, the upper portion up to the chest is mainly governed by Kapha Dosha. The region between the chest and the umbilicus is primarily under the influence of Pitta Dosha, while the area below the umbilicus is dominated by Vata Dosha. Likewise, during the course of a day, the dominance of these doshas varies. In the first part of the day and night, Kapha Dosha is prominent. The second part of the day and night is governed by Pitta Dosha. The third part, both during the day and night, is characterized by the dominance of Vata Dosha. This pattern extends to the process of eating and digestion as well, where Kapha, Pitta, and Vata Doshas dominate the first, second, and third parts respectively. Understanding this distribution helps in comprehending the body's functioning and balance according to Ayurvedic principles.

There are four types of digestive fires (Agni) according to Ayurveda: 1. **Vishama Agni:** This type of Agni is influenced by Vata dosha. Individuals with Vishama Agni experience fluctuations in appetite; sometimes it is high, and at other times, it is low. 2. **Teekshna Agni:** Teekshna Agni is influenced by Pitta dosha. People with Teekshna Agni have high digestion power and appetite. They can efficiently digest food. 3. **Manda Agni:** Manda Agni is influenced by Kapha dosha. Individuals with Manda Agni have low digestion power and appetite. They may find it challenging to digest food properly. 4. **Sama Agni:** Sama Agni is influenced by a perfect balance of all three doshas (Vata, Pitta, and Kapha). People with Sama Agni have a proper appetite and digestion power. Digestion occurs at the appropriate time, indicating a harmonious balance of the doshas. Understanding the type of Agni one has is crucial in Ayurveda, as it helps in determining an individual's dietary and lifestyle choices to maintain optimal health.
